A \textit{Limit Order Book}, or simply, an \textit{Order Book} is a data structure used by
financial exchanges for organising orders for securities. In an actual exchange, a separate order
book is maintained for each security traded. 

Orders have the following fields: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Price} : The price at which the order is placed
    \item \texttt{Quantity} : The volume for which the order is placed
    \item \texttt{Side} : The \tex
\end{itemize}

The data structure must support the following operations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{Insert(Order)} : Given a new order, insert it into the Book
    \item \texttt{Cancel(Order)} : Given an exisitng order, remove it from the Book
    \item \texttt{Modify(Order, NewOrder)} : Given an existing order, replace it with a new, modified order.
\end{enumerate}
